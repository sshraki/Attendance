# Face-API.js Models

This directory should contain the face-api.js model files for face recognition functionality.

To enable full face recognition capabilities, download the following model files from the face-api.js repository and place them in this directory:

- tiny_face_detector_model-weights_manifest.json
- tiny_face_detector_model-shard1
- face_landmark_68_model-weights_manifest.json
- face_landmark_68_model-shard1
- face_recognition_model-weights_manifest.json
- face_recognition_model-shard1
- face_expression_model-weights_manifest.json
- face_expression_model-shard1
- ssd_mobilenetv1_model-weights_manifest.json
- ssd_mobilenetv1_model-shard1
- ssd_mobilenetv1_model-shard2

You can download these from: https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/tree/master/weights

For development purposes, the application will continue to work with limited functionality even without these models.
